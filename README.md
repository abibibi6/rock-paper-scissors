# rock-paper-scissors
JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors Game from the Odin Project

I've learned: 
  - How to return a random item from an array
  - Importance of order
  - How to use console.log to preview each step of the way
  - The difference between = and ==

Things I need to work on:
  - Being able to predict ordering issues before running
  - Generating a GUI
  - Creating an error message -- user cannot continue until the enter a valid input
